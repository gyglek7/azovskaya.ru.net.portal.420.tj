            <div id="desc1" class="description" style="display: none;">
                <p>The building itself is quite large and was built in the early 2000s, it had a lot of infrastructure including a dentist clinic, 2 medical shops, a supermarket, some random street food places which sell all sorts of food ranging from shawarma to sushi and hotdogs. Aside from that, the complex also had a playground with many fun stories associated with it.</p>

            <div id="desc2" class="description" style="display: none;">
                <p>It's just a basic schoolyard that was always open and provided things like a good football/basketball field and a nice place to play games like hide & seek.</p>

            <div id="desc3" class="description" style="display: none;">
                <p>The mall itself is pretty close to our apartments but it has literally anything ranging from a Lidl type of a supermarket to an overpriced tech shop to a huge food court.</p>

            <div id="desc4" class="description" style="display: none;">
                <p>A literal trading place from 2000s which is kinda like a bazar in a way that it is mainly operated by
                     people from unfavorable places like Afghanistan, Chechnya and others. The place itself is called "Sevastopol"
                      and is pretty funny because, back in mid-2010s during my childhood it was visited by the police pretty
                       frequently and there were a lot of junkies wandering around.</p>
